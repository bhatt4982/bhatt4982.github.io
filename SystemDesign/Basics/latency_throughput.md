# Latency and Throughput
## Latency
**Latency** is the time to server a request - measured in units of time
## Throughput
**Throughput** is the number of request handled per unit of time

**[TARGET]** You should aim for **maximal throughput** with **acceptable latency**

Ex. A factory can make one shoe in 1 hr and produces 1k shoes in a day, then
* latency is - 1 hr
* throughput is - 1k/day or 42/hr
